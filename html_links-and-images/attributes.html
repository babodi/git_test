    <h1>Attributes</h1>
    <p>Attributes give additional information to an HTML element and go inside the opening tag. They usually take a value but in some cases don't require one.</p>
    <p>You were able to access this page because the anchor element (a) had an attribute called <strong>href</strong> which had a value that linked to the HTML file you are currently reading.</p>
    <p>To go back to the homepage, click <a href="./index.html">here</a>.</p>
