    <p>These are the common image formats you will encounter on the web.</p>

    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <p>JPG images are the most common type. Their filesize and image quality are the best bang for your buck. They're a good format for photos.</p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" alt="JPG Image">

    <h2>PNGs</h2>
    <p>PNG images percieved as the same quality compared to a JPG are typically larger in filesize. However, they don't have color limitations and deal with opacity better. They're good for logos, icons, etc.</p>

    <h2>GIFs</h2>
    <p>GIFs are ubiquitous image formats for animated pictures.</p>

    <h2>SVGs</h2>
    <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are as the name implies. The image resolution scales when zooming. Test it out on this page and you won't see the pixels as with the other image formats.</p>
    <!-- width alone scales image in proportion, better to use CSS -->
